# silent-filmifier
Script that turns any video into an early 1900s-style silent film. Uses [moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy) to splice video clips and [whisper-timestamped](https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped) to transcribe audio for accurate timing of dialogue cards.

I got the idea for this project from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BsgckzDeRI) about automating TTS Youtube Shorts. I wanted to include it here because it's a cool video, but also because I like being transparent about my inspiration. Ideas are hard to come by sometimes.
