 Okay, pal, here's something interesting. I'll tell a story and I think that'll qualify as what you're requesting. The other day, me and Maddie were having a conversation about like, I think it had something to do with like perspectives on marriage and why it's necessary for it to be involved in certain levels of the legal system. And then it turned into like, oh, crashing weddings is hilarious. Weddings are corny and shit. And then she said, because we were disagreeing and she said, imagine your best friend is getting married. And I said, okay, she said, yeah, yeah, imagine Deccans getting married. And you know what I did for the next five minutes? I laughed because that is comedy. The thought of you in your little wedding dress because you're pussy, it just, it brings me a joy that is not rooted in happiness for you, but happiness for the people who hate you seeing you in that. I think that would be just so wonderful. Like I can't imagine a world in which you find long-lasting happiness through like governmental binding. I think if that were to be the case, then it would be through prison. Like you're bound to a prison cell for the rest of your life. I think that would be fair. You know, given you, I don't think you would disagree. But yeah, I think that's, I think it's pretty hilarious that it can even be conceptualized that you might, you know, one day experience a positive emotion at the hands of somebody else, given how terrible you are. Oh my God, I hate you.
